# Maya's Personal Project:

## Movie and TV Show Tracker

This application will allow users to record and keep track of the movies and TV shows they watch. 
They'll also have the option of having a *Wanting to Watch*  list, where they can list what they 
want to watch in the future.
This app is for people who love watching movies and TV, and who would like to have the opportunity
to look back and see everything they've watched listed in one place. As well as to remeber what they have been 
meaning to watch.  


My friends and I watch a lot of  movies and TV shows and we always say to things like:
- "You have to watch this movie!""
- "Have you seen this show?"
- "What did you think of this movie?"

From this I noticed that it can get difficult keeping track of all the movie/show recommendations you get, or what you thought of an old
show/movie you watched , etc... This application is a solution for these problems.
